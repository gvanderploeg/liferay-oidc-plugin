# OpenID Connect Liferay plugin
This plugin uses the OpenID Connect protocol to make Liferay use external authentication sources like social networks and SSO systems.

## 301 This repository has moved

The plugin source and its documentation have moved from my personal account to [the (proper) location at my employers Github account](https://github.com/finalist/liferay-oidc-plugin).
Please use that project for filing issues as well.
